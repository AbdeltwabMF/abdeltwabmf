<h1 align="center">Hi, As-salamu alaykum ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

### About Me ðŸ˜‡

Greetings! I am Abd El-Twab MF, aka "amf". I was built at the Computers & Systems Engineering Department at Al-Azhar University. I began my journey learning Java in college, then transitioned to C++. I focused on Competitive Programming, which has honed my proficiency in C/C++ and given me a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms. While I've also worked with many other languages, I particularly enjoy working with Go, Shell, and LaTeX.

My hobbies and interests include GNU/Linux, cryptography, cybersecurity, and blockchain technology. Currently, I am focused on Computer Graphics, Operating Systems, and Compilers.
