<h1 align="center">Hi, As-salamu alaykum ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

### About Me ðŸ˜‡

I was built at the Computers & Systems Engineering Department at Al-Azhar University. I began my journey learning Java in college, then transitioned to C++. I focused on Competitive Programming, which has honed my proficiency in C/C++ and given me a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms. While I've also worked with many other languages, I particularly enjoy working with Go, Shell, and LaTeX.

My hobbies and interests include GNU/Linux, cryptography, cybersecurity, and blockchain technology.

Currently, I am focused on Computer Graphics, Operating Systems, and Compilers. While "Abd El-Twab M. Fakhry" is just my mundane name; you can call me "amf".
